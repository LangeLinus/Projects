# Project Promodoro

That code is for a Promodoro Timer with a simple functionality. 
The basic funtions like single session, breaks (short and long) are already working well.

## Problems

The special funtion session is still dont working well. The problem is that the code doesn't work wenn you turn of your phone.
After the first working session the timer stops counting the time. 

## TODOS
1. TODO: Add a function to the code, so that is also can run in the background 
         (-> Maybe use java or cotlin for the mobile version, there are some funtions to do taht easily)

2. TODO: Expand the settings page and add some useful settings

3. TODO: Change the order of the buttons for a better usability.
   (-> Advice from Tim: remove the Home Button and only use the work and break buttons, because home is redundant)
